# Statewide IT 2017 Docker Sessions

This project contains code for the two Docker sessions at Statewide IT 2017.  This uses a simple, three-tier todo list application as a sample for the demos and exercises.  There are versions written in Java, ASP.NET and Node.js to provide something that may be familiar to you.  You can pick any of the three codebases for the exercises and all three work the same way.

## Project Branches
